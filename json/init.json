{"text": "Dear HLS Students,\n\nThese have been painful, difficult times for our nation and our community. The Supreme Court confirmation fight has brought into sharp focus questions about sexual assault, fair process, fitness and character for high office, the integrity of the political process, and more. I appreciate the many students who have spoken out and expressed views on these critical issues.\n\nThere is an immediate reason I write you today. A number of you have written to me to express concerns about Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s teaching in the Winter Term 2019. Though the course is not scheduled to meet for several months, I understand and respect the urgency you have for an answer now. I have written to dozens of you individually. I know that many of you are unsatisfied with the answer that we cannot comment on personnel matters in particular cases. But, as I have said, this policy serves important purposes even in stressful times.\n\nStill, I can provide you this assurance: When concerns and allegations arise about individuals in our teaching program, we take those concerns and allegations seriously, conduct necessary inquiries, complete our process, and then act.\n\nAll best,\n\nJohn M.", "title": "Harvard Law School Dean Won\u2019t Say If Brett Kavanaugh Still Has A Job", "publish_date": "2018-09-28", "img_src": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae87e8240000300096712f.jpeg?ops=1910_1000", "author": "Ashley Feinberg"}
